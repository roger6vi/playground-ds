/*
  Entry point for the design system library.
  - Purpose: re-export components and adapters when they are available.
  - Do not add component implementation here. Components will be added later
    and exported from their own folders (e.g. `src/components/<name>/index.js`).
  - This file is intentionally minimal to provide a clear entry for bundlers.

// Placeholder export surface for the Design System
// Example usage (future): export * from './components/button';
